# StoneClickerGame
A simple recreation of clicker games. The aim being to keep mining (performed by clicking the main rock) and storing up stones (currency) in order to progressively keep going higher and getting more stones.

## Functionality
Clicking on the main rock will cause you to gain some number of stones determined by a main toolEffectiveness parameter which can be upgraded. toolEfficiency is also used to multiply the rate of stone gain from toolEffectiveness and to increase the chance of getting unique ores which are used to upgrade further.
A simple shop system tab is available where you purchase workers (miners) that automatically produce stones for you over time without needing to click on the Rock.
